hello! Everyone, my name is Jeorge Rey M. Antipaso, and I am currently pursuing a 3nd year of college from an Asian college of technology.So I studied a bachelor of science in information technology and have always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and society. 

Well, I had the opportunity to work on several projects that allowed me to explore this intersection in greater depth. One of my greatest experiences was working on a project that involved developing a software application to make monitoring the records of students easier. This project allowed me to use my technical skills to make a positive impact on people's lives. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing basketball and playing Mobile Legend. I find that these activities help me clear my mind and stay focused. Looking ahead, it's exciting to start my career in the tech industry and continue exploring the ways in which technology can be used to make an impact on society.
